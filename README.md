# Python Based Online Poll

An online poll site that runs off of a Python Flask backend, storing votes in a Replit database and displaying them for users to view live in an easy-to-read format.

## Usage Guide

### Setup
Firstly open the file ```current_poll.txt``` and fill it out in this format;
```
Title of The Poll
option1#option 2#option3
```

Note: Spaces can be left between words if needed but words should be left uncapitalised.

Example;
```
Favourite Ice Cream
chocolate#vanilla#mint choc chip#strawberry
```

### Use
Running main.py will initialise the site, bringing users to the home page where they can vote on the live poll.
